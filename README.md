*** Word Cloud Generator ***

*** Description ***
A Java application that can parse a file or a URL to generate a PNG file with a word-cloud
displaying the most prominent words in decreasing font size, style and colour.

*** Features ***
The menu will be displayed and this will offer the user some options on how they want the program to operate.
Menu options include:

	Option 1: enter file name
	Option 2: enter URL name
	Option 3: to Quit the program

Once the user selects there option, they'll be then prompt with a sub menu with three questions.
The three questions are as follows:

	Q1: Enter maximum words to display
	Q2: Enter the file name of the Word-Cloud to save
	Q3: Enter file name

When the user answers these questions and hits enter, the program will run. The program will then create a PNG image, 
with the max number of words that the user wanted to display, the program will then display the most prominent words 
in decreasing font size, style and colour.

******************** SOMETHING ABOUT THE HASHMAP, HASHSET AND PRIORITYQUE ********************

*** Ignore Words File ***
I have added a few of my own words to *ignorewords.txt* and it should be put same directory as the executable when running the program.
The ignorewords.txt will contain a list of words that will not appear in the PNG image.
